Title: Weighted Random Forest for Imbalanced Classification
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: c(person("Sizhang", "Lyu", email = "sl3536@cornell.edu", role = c("aut", "cre")))
Description: Implements a Weighted Random Forest algorithm that incorporates class-dependent weights 
    into the Gini splitting criterion and terminal node predictions. This approach aims to better handle 
    class imbalance by penalizing misclassification of minority classes more heavily, leading to improved 
    predictive performance on imbalanced datasets. Out-of-bag error estimates are provided to guide 
    tuning of class weights.
